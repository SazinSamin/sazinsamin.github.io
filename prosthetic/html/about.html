                <h1>About Prosthetics</h1>
                <p>A hand is one of the most important parts of a human body, and losing that hand can be the end of that person's life. It
                affects his/her physical, psychological, social, and economic life and means the end of the carrier. Prosthetics can be
                an excellent solution to this kind of problem. Prosthetics can be made according to the patient's need and can be
                manufactured easily with the current technology. But this kind of technology is very costly, and the general public can
                not afford these kinds of services. This paper proposes low-cost prosthetics which can be fabricated and used
                economically using hobby-grade 3D printing technology. The prosthetics can be made by designing the part according to
                the patient's requirement and can be fabricated on a small low-cost 3D printer. The proposed prosthetics arm has five
                degrees of freedom, and it can sense the object it touches and gives passive touch-like feelings to the human body using
                haptic feelings. The prosthetics arm has some features like monitoring the health conditions (SpO2, Heart Rate, Body
                Temperature) and giving the temperature of the objects it touches. Three EMG sensors were used with dry electrodes for
                sensing the different muscle data corresponding to different finger movements. A 32-bit Microcontroller with integrated
                wifi and Bluetooth is being used for taking accurate signals from the EMG sensors with its 12-bit ADC and sharing the
                data through IoT. Capacitive touch sensors and force sensors are used for taking the touch data and giving a haptic
                feeling using a haptic vibration motor.</p>
